# MyMotifFinding

This project is designed to identify motifs in peak sequences based on the known motif pwms (position weighted matrix). It provides a Python package that would load reference genome, compute GC content, identify peaks in the sequence, calculate scores of identified motifs, and compute the enrichment of motifs in bound sequences.

**How to run the package**:

**NOTE**: We recommend using JupyterHub to run this package due to possible operating system conflicts and problems regarding package installment.

`cd MyMotifFinding`
`python MyMotifFinding.py -f <path_to_fasta_ref> -transfac <path_to_fac_file> -O <output_directory> <path_to_peaks_file>`

## **Arguments** (required):
* `-f`: path to the indexed reference genome in fasta format
* `-transfac`: path to the **JASPAR** PFM of specific transcription factor in transfac format
* `-O`: path to the directory in which the output is written (will create one if it does not exist)
* path to the **HOMER** peaks.txt output

### **Scripts**:

*Background_Frequency.py*: Calculates the background frequencies of nucleotides from a genome sequence in comparison to a list of sequences obtained from peaks.

*MyMotifFinding.py*: Performs motif finding in a provided peaks file.

*findPValue.py*: Computes the enrichment for each motif and provides Fisher Exact Test p-values.

*utils.py*: Provides utility functions for loading and processing data, and basic calculation on pfms, pwms.

## **Prerequisites**:

**Ensure you have the following installed on your system**:
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. BioPython
3. NumPy
4. SciPy

## **Getting Started**:

**Clone this repository**:
`git clone https://github.com/SaintLucifur/MyMotifFinding.git`

## **Instructions**:

The order to run the scripts would be:

1. Run **MyMotifFinding.py** with required parameters (**HOMER** peaks file, faidx Indexed Referencce Genome fasta file, and transfac file from **JASPAR**):

    `python MyMotifFinding.py -f <path_to_fasta_ref> -transfac <path_to_fac_file> -O <output_directory> <path_to_peaks_file>`
2. (Automatically Run) **Background_Frequency.py** script to calculate the background frequency.
    `python Background_Frequency.py`
3. (Automatically Run) **findPValue.py** to calculate the p-values for motif enrichment.
    `python findPValue.py`
4. The utils.py script does not need to be run directly as it is imported by the other scripts.

**Please replace <path_to_fasta_ref>, <output_file>, <path_to_peaks_file>, and <path_to_fac_file> with your actual file paths.**

## **Testing**:

Minimal test datasets are included in the `Test` folder (you can find it under `MyMotifFinding` folder）for testing purposes.
Datasets in `Test`:
* `peaks.txt`: generated by **HOMER** `findPeaks` function
* `MA0142.1.transfac`: PWM of Sox2/Oct4 transcription factor from **JASPAR**
* `GRCm38.fa`: this indexed fasta file is in `~/public/genomes`, please reference to this location for your fasta file

You can run the scripts with these datasets to verify the functionality of the scripts.
